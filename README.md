SOURCES
I used the FilesExample_SumNums_CheckNums_COMPLETED.cpp file from our class lecture
as a reference to help me create the FileProcessor class. I also got some help from the Chapman TLC (Tutoring Learning Center), specifically from Owen Glidewell and Annika Brown. Additionally, I got some help from Dr.EEL, primarily for sorting out the logic of the gameplay and also discussing what member variables may be needed. Lastly, I used Chat GPT as a debugging tool, (i.e. help me find where I missed a bracket) and to help me better sort my code so it  could be read better.
I also used Chat GPT as a learning tool because I was confused with initializing some of the array componenets. Here are the following links I used reference (also listed in the code file):
